    createStore - creates a Redux store that holds the complete state tree of an app. (reducer, preloadedState, enhancer)
    applyMiddleware - applies middleware, which is the suggested method of extending Redux with custom functionality.
    compose - able to apply several store enhancers.
    combineReducers - helper function that turns an object whose values are different reducing functions into a single reducing function that can be passed to createStore.
